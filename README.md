# **Hi**

### What is Hi. You say Hi every day no matter the individual. It comes into mind no matter the location, situation, and even weather. It's only a simple 2 letter word you say when you greet someone. Why is it so versitile. Why does it have so many meanings. Why do we say it.
### While thinking about the two letter word that includes the English alphabetical word h and i, listen to these East German Music on Spotify.
